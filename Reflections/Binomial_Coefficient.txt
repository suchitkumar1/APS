=>The Binomial Co-efficients can be calculated using the following 3 methods:
Method_1: Recursion
Method_2: Dynamic Programming (2-D Array)
Method_3: Dynamic Programming (1-D Array)

=>Recursion 
This involves calling back the function again for all values.
Diadvantages:
More stack space.
More Processing time.

=>2D array DP
The values are computed and stored in a 2d array. So there is no need to calculate it all again for each of the value.

=>1D Array Dp
The values are computed each time from the previous values. It overites the existing array and gets the new values by adding 
to the previous values.

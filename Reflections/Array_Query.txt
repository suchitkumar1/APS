=>Look up Table Technique:

Application: Maintains a look up table of size n*n which stores the Sum/Max/Min numbers.
Fetch_Efficiency: O(1)
Time_Efficiency: O(N^2)
Space_Efficiency: O(N^2)


=>Square Root Decomposition Technique:

Application: Maintains a table by dividing the array into vn sub-blocks to minimise access time and the index of the smallest element of that range is stored.
Fetch_Efficiency: O(vN)
Time_Efficiency: O(N)
Space_Efficiency: O(N)

=>Segment Tree

Application: This is used only when the data is static. It is a strictly binary tree. Uses bottom-up approach to construct the table.
Time_Efficiency: O(log(N))
